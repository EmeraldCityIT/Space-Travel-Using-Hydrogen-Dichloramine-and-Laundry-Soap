# Space-Travel-Using-Hydrogen-Dichloramine-and-Laundry-Soap
Technology in managing pressure is required for this to exist. In a tank half full of Hydrogen Dichloramine, drop two cups of powdered laundry soap (Tide w/ Bleach) into the tank. The reaction will only take place if space exists in the tank for the reaction to expand. Without releaseing pressure (opening the throttle), the soap will sit at the bottom of the tank. As soon as pressure is released the Soap will react. Pressure released from the tank is used to drive a turbine which creates electricity. The gas is flamable and used for rockets.

The turbine will only generate electricity when creating gas. Presure has to be released into the turbine to maintain a safe burn rate for fuel micture. Gas can be stored in tanks.
